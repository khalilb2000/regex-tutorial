## Anchors

### Description

In regular expressions, anchors (^ and $) are used to assert the position of characters at the beginning and end of a line, respectively. They ensure that the regex matches the entire input.

### Code Example

```regex
^example@example\.com$
Quantifiers
Description
Quantifiers determine the number of occurrences of a character or group in a regex. For email validation, quantifiers can be used to specify the allowed range of characters.

Code Example
regex
Copy code
[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+
Character Classes
Description
Character classes ([ and ]) allow you to define a set of characters. In email validation, character classes are used to specify valid characters for the username and domain.

Code Example
regex
Copy code
[!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]
Grouping and Capturing
Description
Groups ( ) are used to define a subexpression within a regex. Capturing groups can be used to extract parts of the matched text. In email validation, groups can be employed to capture the username and domain separately.

Code Example
regex
Copy code
([a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+)@([a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,})
Look-ahead and Look-behind
Description
Look-ahead (?=) and look-behind (?<=) assertions are used to check if a certain pattern is (or is not) ahead or behind the current position. In email validation, look-ahead can be used to ensure that the username and domain are followed by the correct characters.

Code Example
regex
Copy code
(?=.*[a-zA-Z])
