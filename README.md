## Anchors
In regular expressions, anchors (^ and $) are used to assert the position of characters at the beginning and end of a line, respectively. They ensure that the regex matches the entire input.

## Quantifiers
Quantifiers determine the number of occurrences of a character or group in a regex. For email validation, quantifiers can be used to specify the allowed range of characters.

## Character Classes
Character classes ([ and ]) allow you to define a set of characters. In email validation, character classes are used to specify valid characters for the username and domain.

## Grouping and Capturing
Groups ( ) are used to define a subexpression within a regex. Capturing groups can be used to extract parts of the matched text. In email validation, groups can be employed to capture the username and domain separately.
## Look-ahead and Look-behind
Look-ahead (?=) and look-behind (?<=) assertions are used to check if a certain pattern is (or is not) ahead or behind the current position. In email validation, look-ahead can be used to ensure that the username and domain are followed by the correct characters.
